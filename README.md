DISCLAIMER: I wasn't able to run it due to anaconda not being connected to the python file so it gave me an error when trying to run it with the csv file it would help if you showed us how to do that again and added a video tutorial to canvas that we could go back and look at since we only did it once before
I added the import os and csv
Then in the main I added all of the function names for the different searches and sorts and for calculating the percenages and the averages and the print statements to go with them
Then I added a keep going variable to run the program again if the user entered y 
Then I have all the functions for the different searches and sorts and for calculating the percenages and the averages
Then at the end I added a while loop to get the program to run again as long as the user entered y which also has the main inside it too
