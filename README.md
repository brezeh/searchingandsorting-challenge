DISCLAIMER: I was able to run it this time and it worked but on my end it wouldn't load to let me ender a student id and it didn't show me the the records by Reading Score (ascending) and Math Score (descending) and it didn't calculate average grade and pass percentage for each grade either but it should work 
I added the import os and csv
Then in the main I added all of the function names for the different searches and sorts and for calculating the percenages and the averages and the print statements to go with them
Then I added a keep going variable to run the program again if the user entered y 
Then I have all the functions for the different searches and sorts and for calculating the percenages and the averages
Then at the end I added a while loop to get the program to run again as long as the user entered y which also has the main inside it too
